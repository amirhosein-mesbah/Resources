# Resources for Reinforcement Learning (RL)

## RL Researchers
I am trying to maintain a [list of RL researchers](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vyiKcpKuroBg0tht0g-CsyENLb09TXTscXBOQOwqxoI/edit?usp=sharing) (faculty members, PhD students, and industry researchers) with their research focus and goals. If you think I have missed anyone please don't hesitate to get in touch through email or any other channels. There is no specific order and I'll update the list based on my exploration.
